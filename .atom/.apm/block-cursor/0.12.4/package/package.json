To avoid complication, you have to use these to get an alpha on the cursor, so setting an alpha on the `primaryColor` or `secondaryColor` doesn't do anything.\n\n### blink interval\n\nThe blinking interval of the cursor. Set to `0` to disable cursor blinking.\n\n### pulse duration\n\nA pulse effect that fades the cursor from `primaryColor` to `secondaryColor`. Set to 0 to disable.\n\n![Block cursor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/olmokramer/atom-block-cursor/master/cursor-pulse.gif)\n\n### cursor thickness\n\nThe thickness of the non-block cursors.\n\n### use hardware acceleration\n\nUse hardware acceleration on certain animations. Currently only when `secondaryColorAlpha` is set to `0`.\n\n### cursor line fix\n\nWhen your syntax theme uses a `background-color` on `.cursor-line` - the line the cursor is on - the `block` cursor may become invisible. This is because the cursor has a `z-index` of `-1`, to make it render behind the text instead of above it. This fix sets the cursor's `z-index` to `1`, to make it render above the text, so you should use low `alpha` values for `primaryColor` and `secondaryColor` if you enable this fix.\n\nYou can also add this to your `styles.less` to disable the line highlight:\n```less\natom-text-editor::shadow .lines .line.cursor-line {\n  background-color: transparent;\n}\n```k\n\n## scoped config\n\nWith scoped config you can yave a different cursor for every language. Create a scope in `~/.atom/config.cson` and override the global options for that scope. When a property is not defined for a scope it will default to the global config.\n\nExample:\n```cson\n# a gray cursor by default but when in a coffee-script file\n# the cursor is pink and blinks twice as fast\n'*': # global scope\n  'block-cursor':\n    primaryColor:\n      red: 57\n      green: 57\n      blue: 57\n      alpha: 1\n'.coffee.source': # coffee-script scope\n  'block-cursor':\n    secondaryColor:\n      red: 255\n      green: 0\n      blue: 255\n      alpha: 1\n    blinkInterval: 400\n```\n\n## known issues\n\n* Blink interval doesn't work in `mini` editors - the single line input fields, for example in settings or the command palette - except for disabling blink.\n\n## contribute\n\nHave other neat ideas for cursor customization?
